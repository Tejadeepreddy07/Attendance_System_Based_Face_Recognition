Title			:  Attendance System Based Face Recognition

Project Description	: This project is an attendance system based on face recognition that uses OpenCV, dlib, Flask, and Python. 
The system captures images of individuals using a camera, stores them in a folder, and converts the data 
into an Excel sheet (features_all.csv). It compares the images when taking attendance and marks the attendance in a database. 
Finally, Flask is used to create a local server to display daily attendance on a webpage
